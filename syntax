All the problems text have to syntactically follow the grammar below:

problem = description + hypotehsis + conclusion

	description = some text

	hypotehsis = "Hypothesis:" + arbitrary + semiarbitrary + deterministic + (constraint)?   /* constraint between defined elements */

		arbitrary = arbitrary_circle + (arbitrary_point)*

			arbitrary_circle = "Let an arbitrary circle " + circle_name + "(" + point + ", radix)" /* circle(center, radix)*/ 

			arbitrary_point  = "Let an arbitrary point " + point 
	
		semiarbitrary = (semiarbitrary_point)* + (euler_circle)?  /* this is a geometric locus of a point - can be a line, a circle, etc"

			semiarbitrary_point = "Let a semiarbitrary point " + point + " situated on " + equation_hyp_double

			euler_circle = "Let the Euler circle with respect to triangle " + point + point + point + "be " + circle_name + "(omega, radix_E)"  /* each point must be on circle(center, radix) */

		deterministic = (deterministic_point_single | deterministic_point_double)*

			deterministic_point_single = "Let a 1-equation deterministic point " + point + " situated on " + equation_hyp_single
			deterministic_point_double = "Let a 2-equations deterministic point " + point + " situated on " + equation_hyp_double + " and " + equation_hyp_double

		constraint__ = "Constraint: " + constraint

	conclusion = "Conclusion:" + equation_concl

===================================================

equation_hyp_double = line |
