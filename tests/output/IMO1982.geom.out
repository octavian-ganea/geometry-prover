======= The conclusion may be correct only unde the following restrictions:
 -- points T2 and T1 can not be symmetric with respect to the center of the arbitrary circle 
 -- points I and A3 must be different
 -- points T3 and T1 can not be symmetric with respect to the center of the arbitrary circle 
 -- points I and A2 must be different
 -- points T3 and T2 can not be symmetric with respect to the center of the arbitrary circle 
 -- points I and A1 must be different
 -- points T2 and T1 must be different
 -- points T3 and T1 must be different
 -- points T3 and T2 must be different
