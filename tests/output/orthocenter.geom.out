Hypothesis:

Let an arbitrary circle Circ(O,radix)

Let a semiarbitrary point A situated on circle Circ
Let a semiarbitrary point B situated on circle Circ
Let a semiarbitrary point C situated on circle Circ

Let a 2-equations deterministic point A1 situated on line B-C and line A-A1 perpendicular on line B-C
Let a 2-equations deterministic point B1 situated on line A-C and line B-B1 perpendicular on line A-C
Let a 2-equations deterministic point C1 situated on line A-B and line C-C1 perpendicular on line A-B
Let a 2-equations deterministic point H situated on line A-A1 and line B-B1

========= List of arbitrary points:


========= List of semi-arbitrary points:

A is defined by equation: a * a__ - 1 = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 a__ = 1  / a

B is defined by equation: b * b__ - 1 = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 b__ = 1  / b

C is defined by equation: c * c__ - 1 = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 c__ = 1  / c

========= List of deterministic points:

A1 is defined by equation: a1 * b__ + b * c__ + a1__ * c - a1 * c__ - a1__ * b - b__ * c = 0
         and by equation: a * c__ + a1 * b__ + a__ * c + a1__ * b - a * b__ - a1 * c__ - a1__ * c - a__ * b = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 a1  =  a * c + a^2 + a * b - b * c  / 2 * a
 a1__  =  a * b + b * c + a * c - a^2  / 2 * a * b * c 


B1 is defined by equation: a__ * b1 + a * c__ + b1__ * c - b1 * c__ - a * b1__ - a__ * c = 0
         and by equation: b * c__ + a__ * b1 + b__ * c + a * b1__ - a__ * b - b1 * c__ - b1__ * c - a * b__ = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 b1  =  b * c + b^2 + a * b - a * c  / 2 * b
 b1__  =  a * b + a * c + b * c - b^2  / 2 * a * b * c 


C1 is defined by equation: a__ * c1 + a * b__ + b * c1__ - b__ * c1 - a * c1__ - a__ * b = 0
         and by equation: b__ * c + a__ * c1 + b * c__ + a * c1__ - a__ * c - b__ * c1 - b * c1__ - a * c__ = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 c1  =  b * c + c^2 + a * c - a * b  / 2 * c
 c1__  =  a * c + a * b + b * c - c^2  / 2 * a * b * c 


H is defined by equation: a__ * h + a * a1__ + a1 * h__ - a1__ * h - a * h__ - a1 * a__ = 0
         and by equation: b__ * h + b * b1__ + b1 * h__ - b1__ * h - b * h__ - b1 * b__ = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 h  =  c + b + a
 h__  =  a * b + a * c + b * c  / a * b * c 


X13 is defined by equation: a__ * x13 + a * a1__ + a1 * x13__ - a1__ * x13 - a * x13__ - a1 * a__ = 0
         and by equation: b__ * x13 + b * b1__ + b1 * x13__ - b1__ * x13 - b * x13__ - b1 * b__ = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 x13  =  c + b + a
 x13__  =  a * b + a * c + b * c  / a * b * c
