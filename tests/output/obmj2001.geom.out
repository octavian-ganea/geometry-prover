 b__ = 1  / b

C is defined by equation: c * c__ - 1 = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 c__ = 1  / c

A is defined by equation: a * c__ + a__ * b + a__ * c + a * b__ - 2 * a * a__ - b * c__ - b__ * c = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 a__ = a * b + a * c - b^2 - c^2  / 2 * a * b * c - b^2 * c - b * c^2

========= List of deterministic points:

D is defined by equation: a__ * d + a * b__ + b * d__ - b__ * d - a * d__ - a__ * b = 0
         and by equation: d * d__ - 1 = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 d  =  c^2 + b * c - 2 * a * c  / b - c

E is defined by equation: a__ * e + a * c__ + c * e__ - c__ * e - a * e__ - a__ * c = 0
         and by equation: e * e__ - 1 = 0

         and by equation: a * c__ + b__ * s + a__ * c + b * s__ - a * b__ - c__ * s - c * s__ - a__ * b = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:

======= The conclusion may be correct only unde the following restrictions:
 -- points C and B can not be symmetric with respect to the center of the arbitrary circle 
 -- points E and C must be different
 -- points C and A must be different
 -- points C and B must be different
 -- points D and B must be different
 -- points B and A must be different
