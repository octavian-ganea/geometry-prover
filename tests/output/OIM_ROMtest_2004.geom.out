========= List of arbitrary points:


========= List of semi-arbitrary points:

X is defined by equation: x * x__ - 1 = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 x__ = 1  / x

Y is defined by equation: y * y__ - 1 = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 y__ = 1  / y

Z is defined by equation: z * z__ - 1 = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 z__ = 1  / z

========= List of deterministic points:

A is defined by equation: a + a__ * y^2 - 2 * y = 0
         and by equation: a + a__ * z^2 - 2 * z = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 a  =  2 * y * z  / z + y
 a__  =  2  / y + z 


B is defined by equation: b + b__ * x^2 - 2 * x = 0
         and by equation: b + b__ * z^2 - 2 * z = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 b  =  2 * x * z  / z + x
 b__  =  2  / x + z 


C is defined by equation: c + c__ * y^2 - 2 * y = 0
         and by equation: c + c__ * x^2 - 2 * x = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 c  =  2 * x * y  / y + x
 c__  =  2  / x + y 


P is defined by equation: a__ * p + a * x__ + p__ * x - p * x__ - a * p__ - a__ * x = 0
         and by equation: b__ * p + b * y__ + p__ * y - p * y__ - b * p__ - b__ * y = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 p  =  2 * y^2 * z^2 + 2 * x^2 * y^2 + 2 * x^2 * z^2 - 2 * x * y * z^2 - 2 * x * y^2 * z - 2 * x^2 * y * z  / x^2 * z + x * y^2 + y^2 * z + y * z^2 + x^2 * y + x * z^2 - 6 * x * y * z

M is defined by equation: m * x__ + x * z__ + m__ * z - m * z__ - m__ * x - x__ * z = 0
         and by equation: a__ * m + a * c__ + c * m__ - c__ * m - a * m__ - a__ * c = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 m  =  y^2 * z + x * y^2 - 2 * x * y * z  / y^2 - x * z
 m__  =  x + z - 2 * y  / x * z - y^2 


N is defined by equation: b__ * n + b * c__ + c * n__ - c__ * n - b * n__ - b__ * c = 0
         and by equation: n * y__ + y * z__ + n__ * z - n * z__ - n__ * y - y__ * z = 0

 n__  =  2 * x - y - z  / x^2 - y * z

======= The conclusion may be correct only unde the following restrictions:
 -- points Y and X can not be symmetric with respect to the center of the arbitrary circle 
 -- points Z and X can not be symmetric with respect to the center of the arbitrary circle 
 -- points Z and Y can not be symmetric with respect to the center of the arbitrary circle 
 -- points Y and X must be different
 -- points Z and X must be different
 -- points Z and Y must be different
