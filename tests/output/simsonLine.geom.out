Hypothesis:

Let an arbitrary circle Circ(O,radix)

Let a semiarbitrary point A situated on circle Circ
Let a semiarbitrary point B situated on circle Circ
Let a semiarbitrary point C situated on circle Circ
Let a semiarbitrary point M situated on circle Circ

Let a 1-equation deterministic point A1 situated on projection of M on line B-C
Let a 1-equation deterministic point B1 situated on projection of M on line A-C
Let a 1-equation deterministic point C1 situated on projection of M on line B-A

====== Parse OK 

====== Proof of the problem:

======= Generating equations for each point ... 

========= List of arbitrary points:


========= List of semi-arbitrary points:

A is defined by equation: a * a__ - 1 = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 a__ = 1  / a

B is defined by equation: b * b__ - 1 = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 b__ = 1  / b

C is defined by equation: c * c__ - 1 = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 c__ = 1  / c

M is defined by equation: m * m__ - 1 = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 m__ = 1  / m

========= List of deterministic points:

A1 is a deterministic point defined by equations (After substitutions and simplifications):
 
 a1  =  c * m + m^2 + b * m - b * c  / 2 * m 

 a1__  =  b * m + b * c + c * m - m^2  / 2 * b * c * m 


B1 is a deterministic point defined by equations (After substitutions and simplifications):
 
 b1  =  c * m + m^2 + a * m - a * c  / 2 * m 

 b1__  =  a * m + a * c + c * m - m^2  / 2 * a * c * m 


C1 is a deterministic point defined by equations (After substitutions and simplifications):
 
 c1  =  b * m + m^2 + a * m - a * b  / 2 * m 

 c1__  =  a * m + a * b + b * m - m^2  / 2 * a * b * m 

=========== Equations were generated successfully ========

======= The conclusion may be correct only unde the following restrictions:
 -- points B and A must be different
 -- points C and A must be different
 -- points C and B must be different
