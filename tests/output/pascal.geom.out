========= List of arbitrary points:


========= List of semi-arbitrary points:

A is defined by equation: a * a__ - 1 = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 a__ = 1  / a

B is defined by equation: b * b__ - 1 = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 b__ = 1  / b

C is defined by equation: c * c__ - 1 = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 c__ = 1  / c

D is defined by equation: d * d__ - 1 = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 d__ = 1  / d

E is defined by equation: e * e__ - 1 = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 e__ = 1  / e

F is defined by equation: f * f__ - 1 = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 f__ = 1  / f

========= List of deterministic points:

X is defined by equation: a__ * x + a * b__ + b * x__ - b__ * x - a * x__ - a__ * b = 0
         and by equation: d__ * x + d * e__ + e * x__ - e__ * x - d * x__ - d__ * e = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 x  =  a * b * e + a * b * d - b * d * e - a * d * e  / a * b - d * e
 x__  =  d + e - a - b  / d * e - a * b 


Y is defined by equation: c__ * y + b__ * c + b * y__ - b__ * y - c * y__ - b * c__ = 0
         and by equation: e__ * y + e * f__ + f * y__ - f__ * y - e * y__ - e__ * f = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 y  =  c * e * f + b * e * f - b * c * f - b * c * e  / e * f - b * c
 y__  =  b + c - e - f  / b * c - e * f 


Z is defined by equation: c__ * z + c * d__ + d * z__ - d__ * z - c * z__ - c__ * d = 0
         and by equation: f__ * z + a__ * f + a * z__ - a__ * z - f * z__ - a * f__ = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 z  =  a * d * f + a * c * f - c * d * f - a * c * d  / a * f - c * d
 z__  =  c + d - a - f  / c * d - a * f
