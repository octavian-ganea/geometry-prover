====== Parsing .... 
Description : intersection of altitudes in a triangle is a single point - the ortocenter 

Hypothesis:

Let an arbitrary circle Circ(O,radix)

Let a semiarbitrary point A situated on circle Circ
Let a semiarbitrary point B situated on circle Circ
Let a semiarbitrary point C situated on circle Circ
Let a semiarbitrary point D situated on circle Circ


Conclusion: points A, B, C and D are concyclic

====== Parse OK 

====== Proof of the problem:

======= Generating equations for each point ... 

========= List of arbitrary points:


========= List of semi-arbitrary points:

A is defined by equation: a * a__ - 1 = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 a__ = 1  / a

B is defined by equation: b * b__ - 1 = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 b__ = 1  / b

C is defined by equation: c * c__ - 1 = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 c__ = 1  / c

D is defined by equation: d * d__ - 1 = 0
After substitutions and simplifications:
 d__ = 1  / d

========= List of deterministic points:
=========== Equations were generated successfully ========


====== Trying to solve the goal of the problem ...
Conclusion is equivalent to equation: 
a__ * c * d * d__ + b__ * c * c__ * d + a * a__ * b * d__ + a * b * b__ * c__ + a * c * c__ * d__ + a * a__ * b__ * c + a * a__ * c__ * d + a * b__ * d * d__ + a__ * b * c * c__ + b * b__ * c * d__ + b * c__ * d * d__ + a__ * b * b__ * d - a * a__ * c * d__ - a * b__ * c * c__ - a__ * c * c__ * d - b__ * c * d * d__ - a * a__ * b * c__ - a * b * b__ * d__ - a__ * b * d * d__ - b * b__ * c__ * d - a * c__ * d * d__ - a * a__ * b__ * d - b * c * c__ * d__ - a__ * b * b__ * c = 0
