Description : intersection of altitudes in a triangle is a single point - the ortocenter

Hypothesis:

Let an arbitrary circle Circ(O ,radix)

Let an semiarbitrary point A situated on circle Circ
Let an semiarbitrary point B situated on circle Circ
Let an semiarbitrary point C situated on circle Circ

Let a 2-equations deterministic point A1 situated on line B C and line A A1 perpendicular on line B C
Let a 2-equations deterministic point B1 situated on line A C and line B B1 perpendicular on line A C
Let a 2-equations deterministic point C1 situated on line A B and line C C1 perpendicular on line A B

Let a 2-equations deterministic point H situated on line A A1 and line B B1
Conclusion: 


concurrent line A A1 line B B1 line C C1


//
collinear H C C1
