Description : IMO 1982 problem 2

Hypothesis:

Let an arbitrary circle Inscr( I ,radix)

Let an semiarbitrary point T1 situated on circle Inscr
Let an semiarbitrary point T2 situated on circle Inscr
Let an semiarbitrary point T3 situated on circle Inscr

Let a 2-equations deterministic point A1 situated on tangent at circle Inscr in point T2  and tangent at circle Inscr in point T3
Let a 2-equations deterministic point A2 situated on tangent at circle Inscr in point T1  and tangent at circle Inscr in point T3
Let a 2-equations deterministic point A3 situated on tangent at circle Inscr in point T1  and tangent at circle Inscr in point T2

Let a 1-equation deterministic point M1 situated on midpoint of A2 A3
Let a 1-equation deterministic point M2 situated on midpoint of A1 A3
Let a 1-equation deterministic point M3 situated on midpoint of A2 A1


Let a 1-equation deterministic point B1 situated on projection of T1 on line A1 I
Let a 1-equation deterministic point B2 situated on projection of T2 on line A2 I
Let a 1-equation deterministic point B3 situated on projection of T3 on line A3 I

Let a 1-equation deterministic point S1 situated on symmetric point of T1 with respect to B1
Let a 1-equation deterministic point S2 situated on symmetric point of T2 with respect to B2
Let a 1-equation deterministic point S3 situated on symmetric point of T3 with respect to B3

Conclusion:

concurrent  line M1 S1  line M2 S2  line M3 S3
