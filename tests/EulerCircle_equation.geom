Description : ecuation of the Euler Circle : midpoint of HM is always on Euler circle when M moves on the circumscribed circle of tr ABC

Hypothesis:

Let an arbitrary circle Circ(O ,radix)

Let an semiarbitrary point A situated on circle Circ
Let an semiarbitrary point B situated on circle Circ
Let an semiarbitrary point C situated on circle Circ
Let an semiarbitrary point M situated on circle Circ

Let a 1-equation deterministic point A1 situated on projection of A on line B C
Let a 1-equation deterministic point B1 situated on projection of B on line A C
Let a 1-equation deterministic point C1 situated on projection of C on line B A

Let a 2-equations deterministic point H situated on line A A1 and line B B1

Let a 1-equation deterministic point N situated on midpoint of H M
Let a 1-equation deterministic point A2 situated on midpoint of B C
Let a 1-equation deterministic point B2 situated on midpoint of A C
Let a 1-equation deterministic point C2 situated on midpoint of A B



Conclusion: 


concyclic points A2 B2 C2 N
