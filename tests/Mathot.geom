Description : mathot's theorem

Hypothesis:

Let an arbitrary circle Circ(O ,radix)

Let an semiarbitrary point A situated on circle Circ
Let an semiarbitrary point B situated on circle Circ
Let an semiarbitrary point C situated on circle Circ
Let an semiarbitrary point D situated on circle Circ

Let a 1-equation deterministic point A1 situated on midpoint of A B
Let a 1-equation deterministic point B1 situated on midpoint of B C
Let a 1-equation deterministic point C1 situated on midpoint of C D
Let a 1-equation deterministic point D1 situated on midpoint of D A

Let a 1-equation deterministic point A2 situated on projection of A1 on line C D
Let a 1-equation deterministic point B2 situated on projection of B1 on line A D
Let a 1-equation deterministic point C2 situated on projection of C1 on line A B
Let a 1-equation deterministic point D2 situated on projection of D1 on line B C



Conclusion: 

concurrent line A2 A1 line B2 B1 line C2 C1


Let a 2-equations deterministic point M situated on line A A1 and line B B1
