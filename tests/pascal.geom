Hypothesis:

Let an arbitrary circle Circ(O ,radix)

Let an semiarbitrary point A situated on circle Circ
Let an semiarbitrary point B situated on circle Circ
Let an semiarbitrary point C situated on circle Circ
Let an semiarbitrary point D situated on circle Circ
Let an semiarbitrary point E situated on circle Circ
Let an semiarbitrary point F situated on circle Circ

Let a 2-equations deterministic point X situated on line A B and line D E
Let a 2-equations deterministic point Y situated on line C B and line E F
Let a 2-equations deterministic point Z situated on line C D and line F A

Conclusion:

collinear X Y Z
