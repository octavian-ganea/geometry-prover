Hypothesis:

Let an arbitrary circle Circ(O ,radix)

Let an semiarbitrary point A situated on circle Circ
Let an semiarbitrary point B situated on circle Circ
Let an semiarbitrary point C situated on circle Circ

Let a 1-equation deterministic point A1 situated on projection of A on line B C
Let a 1-equation deterministic point B1 situated on projection of B on line A C
Let a 1-equation deterministic point C1 situated on projection of C on line A B


Let a 2-equations deterministic point H situated on line A A1 and line B B1

Let a 1-equation deterministic point A2 situated on symmetric point of H with respect to A1
Let a 1-equation deterministic point B2 situated on symmetric point of H with respect to B1
Let a 1-equation deterministic point C2 situated on symmetric point of H with respect to C1

Let a 2-equations deterministic point X situated on line X A2 parallel with line A O and line X B2 parallel with line B O

Let a 2-equations deterministic point Y situated on line Y A2 parallel with line A O and line Y C2 parallel with line C O

Conclusion: 


concurrent line A2 X line B2 X line C2 Y
