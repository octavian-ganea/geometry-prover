Hypothesis:

Let an arbitrary circle Circ( O ,radix)

Let an semiarbitrary point B situated on circle Circ
Let an semiarbitrary point C situated on circle Circ
Let an semiarbitrary point A situated on line A B perpendicular on line A C


Let a 2-equations deterministic point D situated on line A B and circle Circ
Let a 2-equations deterministic point E situated on line A C and circle Circ


Let a 2-equations deterministic point S situated on line B C and line A S perpendicular on line B C
Let a 2-equations deterministic point K situated on line D E and line A S 

Let a 1-equation deterministic point M situated on midpoint of B C

Conclusion: line A K parallel with line O M 


//in fact we need AKOM paralelogram
