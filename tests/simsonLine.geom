Hypothesis:

Let an arbitrary circle Circ(O ,radix)

Let an semiarbitrary point A situated on circle Circ
Let an semiarbitrary point B situated on circle Circ
Let an semiarbitrary point C situated on circle Circ
Let an semiarbitrary point M situated on circle Circ

Let a 1-equation deterministic point A1 situated on projection of M on line B C
Let a 1-equation deterministic point B1 situated on projection of M on line A C
Let a 1-equation deterministic point C1 situated on projection of M on line B A


Conclusion: 


collinear A1 B1 C1
