Description : Gauss theorem

Hypothesis:

Let an arbitrary circle Circ(O ,radix)
Let an arbitrary point D
Let an arbitrary point C
Let an arbitrary point B
Let an arbitrary point A



Let a 2-equations deterministic point X situated on line A B and line C D
Let a 2-equations deterministic point Y situated on line C B and line A D

Let a 1-equation deterministic point M situated on midpoint of A C
Let a 1-equation deterministic point N situated on midpoint of B D
Let a 1-equation deterministic point P situated on midpoint of X Y


Conclusion:

collinear M N P



Let an semiarbitrary point A situated on circle Circ
Let an semiarbitrary point B situated on circle Circ
Let an semiarbitrary point C situated on circle Circ
