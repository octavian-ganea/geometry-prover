Description : intersection of altitudes in a triangle is a single point - the ortocenter

Hypothesis:

Let an arbitrary circle Circ(O ,radix)

Let an semiarbitrary point A situated on circle Circ
Let an semiarbitrary point B situated on circle Circ
Let an semiarbitrary point C situated on circle Circ

Let a 1-equation deterministic point A1 situated on midpoint of B C
Let a 1-equation deterministic point C1 situated on midpoint of B A
Let a 1-equation deterministic point B1 situated on midpoint of A C

Conclusion:
concurrent line A A1 line B B1 line C C1
