Hypothesis:

Let an arbitrary circle Circ(O ,radix)

Let an semiarbitrary point A situated on circle Circ
Let an semiarbitrary point B situated on circle Circ
Let an semiarbitrary point C situated on circle Circ

Let a 2-equations deterministic point A1 situated on line B C and line A A1 perpendicular on line B C
Let a 2-equations deterministic point B1 situated on line A C and line B B1 perpendicular on line A C

Let a 1-equation deterministic point M situated on midpoint of B C
Let a 1-equation deterministic point N situated on midpoint of B A

Let a 2-equations deterministic point G situated on line A M and line C N
Let a 2-equations deterministic point H situated on line A A1 and line B B1


Conclusion: 

collinear O H G
