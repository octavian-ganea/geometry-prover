Description : intersection of altitudes in a triangle is a single point - the ortocenter

Hypothesis:

Let an arbitrary circle Circ(O ,radix)

Let an arbitrary point A
Let an arbitrary point B
Let an arbitrary point C

Let a 1-equation deterministic point A1 situated on projection of A on line B C
Let a 1-equation deterministic point B1 situated on projection of B on line A C
Let a 1-equation deterministic point C1 situated on projection of C on line B A

Conclusion: 

concurrent line A A1 line B B1 line C C1
