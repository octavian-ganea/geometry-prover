Let a 1-equation deterministic point A2 situated on projection of M on line B C
Let a 1-equation deterministic point B2 situated on projection of M on line A C
Let a 1-equation deterministic point C2 situated on projection of M on line A B

Let a 2-equations deterministic point H situated on line A A1 and line B B1

Let a 1-equation deterministic point A3 situated on symmetric point of H with respect to A1
Let a 1-equation deterministic point B3 situated on symmetric point of H with respect to B1
Let a 1-equation deterministic point C3 situated on symmetric point of H with respect to C1

Let a 1-equation deterministic point A4 situated on symmetric point of M with respect to A2
Let a 1-equation deterministic point B4 situated on symmetric point of M with respect to B2
Let a 1-equation deterministic point C4 situated on symmetric point of M with respect to C2
